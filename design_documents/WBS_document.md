TCGA matchmaker
- Activity 1: Set up GitHub repository
  - [X] Task 1.1: Set up GitHub repository
  - [X] Task 1.2: Create high-level description document
  - [X] Task 1.3: Create code structure
- Activity 2: Build prototype I
  - Activity 2.1 : Refine design to describe tasks
    - [ ] Task 2.1.1: Break project into activities
    - [ ] Task 2.1.2: Break project into tasks
  - Activity 2.2: Define high-level functions
    - [ ] Task 2.2.1: Define read/create data function
    - [ ] Task 2.2.2: Define analysis function
    - [ ] Task 2.2.3: Define save output function
  - Activity 2.3: Implement read data and save output and one feature in the analsyis
    - [ ] Task 2.3.1: Implement read/create data function
    - [ ] Task 2.3.2: Implement one analysis function: compute profile score for 1 TCGA sample
          - [ ] The first implementation of this function will be with a mockup input (like two numbers) and a simple output - the difference
          - [ ] The next step is to have a proper input in the correct format - just that it will be a scaled up input - just a small matrix 4x2 for instance and for that I compute a simple match score again: the sum of the differences between my sample and my reference profile    
    - [ ] Task 2.3.3: Implement save output function
  - Activity 2.4: Test prototype 
- Activity 3: Build prototype II
